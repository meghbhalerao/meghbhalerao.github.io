I am a Master's Student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I like ML and Math. I was a Project Assistant at the [Image Analysis and Compter Vision Lab](https://sites.google.com/iisc.ac.in/somabiswas/iacv-lab-iisc), EE Department, at the Indian Institute of Science with Prof. Soma Biswas. I worked on Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision using Deep Learning.

I have also collaborated with [Prof. Sheng Wang]() in UW CSE where I worked on Biomedical Natural Language Procesing.
I completed my Undergraduate Thesis (in 2019) working on Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images at the Center of  Biomedical Image Computing and Analysis, University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Spyridon Bakas. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. CMC Krishnan. 
I graduated with a B.Tech in EE from NITK, Surathkal (2020).</p>

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
