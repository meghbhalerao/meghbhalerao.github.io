I am a Master's Student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I like ML and Math. I was a Project Assistant at the [Image Analysis and Compter Vision Lab](https://sites.google.com/iisc.ac.in/somabiswas/iacv-lab-iisc), EE Department, at the Indian Institute of Science with Prof. Soma Biswas. I worked on Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision using Deep Learning.

I have also collaborated with [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) in UW CSE where I worked on Biomedical Natural Language Procesing.
I completed my Undergraduate Thesis (2019) working on Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images at the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analysis](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/), University of Pennsylvania with [Prof. Spyridon Bakas](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/sbakas/). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Krishnan CMC](https://sites.google.com/view/krishnan-chemmangat). 
I graduated with a B.Tech in EE from NITK, Surathkal (2020).</p>
