I am a Master's Student studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. My broad areas of interest are Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I am a member of the [MELODI Lab](https://melodi.ece.uw.edu), advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Bilmes](https://people.ece.uw.edu/bilmes/p/pgs/index.html). I primarily work at the intersection of Submodularity, Computer Vision, and Data Summarization. I have also collaborated with [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) at UW CSE (2022) where I worked on Biomedical Natural Language Procesing.

I was a Project Assistant (2020 - 2021) in the [Image Analysis and Compter Vision Lab](https://sites.google.com/iisc.ac.in/somabiswas/iacv-lab-iisc) at the Indian Institute of Science working with [Prof. Soma Biswas](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/soma-biswas/) where I primarily worked on Domain Adaptation, Semi-supervised Learning

I completed my Undergraduate Thesis (2019) working on Medical Image Semantic Segmentation at the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analysis](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/), University of Pennsylvania with [Prof. Spyridon Bakas](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/sbakas/). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Krishnan CMC](https://sites.google.com/view/krishnan-chemmangat). 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India in 2020.
